        <h2><strong>Most recent election polls us Election results riding</strong></h2>
        <p>A regular, full-time employee will take on additional duties during the <b>election</b>, such as counting absentee ballots and performing prep work for the November elections. Then, on Election <b>Day</b> she will be assisting those at the polling places. Is she considered an election worker?  Governments typically pay <b>election</b> <b>workers</b> a set fee for each <b>day</b> of <b>work</b>. Election workers&#39; wages are includible in gross income as compensation for services. Section 61(a)(1). An individual employed as an election worker may also perform services for the government in another capacity.  Whether you are an <b>election</b> <b>worker</b> or a city official, it&#39;s important to understand the <b>tax</b> laws surrounding <b>election</b> <b>worker</b> compensation. Learn more.  Poll (election) workers are exempt from FICA tax for the first <b>$2,300</b>. Poll workers paid less than the federal threshold amount mandated by law are excluded from coverage. Therefore, Social Security and Medicare taxes will not apply until the poll worker is paid $2,300 or more.  That depends on which state you <b>work</b> in. Most of those 28 states that have voting leave laws plus Washington, D.C., also require your job to pay you for time spent voting during <b>work</b> hours. The ...  In the Washington, D.C., employees are entitled to up to two hours of paid leave to vote in either an <b>election</b> held in D.C. if the employee is eligible to vote in D.C., or in an <b>election</b> held in the jurisdiction in which the employee is eligible to vote. Employees must submit requests for leave a reasonable time in advance of the <b>election</b> date.  If you&rsquo;re one of the millions of Americans who will be serving as an election worker on November 6, you may have questions about your compensation&mdash;and the tax laws that apply to this income. In today&rsquo;s post, we examine the tax breaks associated with <b>election</b> <b>worker</b> income.  Current Law. From January 1, 2024 forward, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) <b>tax</b> exclusion for <b>election</b> officials and <b>election</b> <b>workers</b> is $2,300 a calendar year, unless those wages are subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes under the State&#39;s Section 218 Agreement.  Filing taxes on income earned from <b>working</b> at a polling place during a general or primary election isn&#39;t difficult, but you do have to pay attention to your FICA contributions. If you earn more than $600 as a poll <b>worker</b>, you will receive a W-2 and report your election worker pay on Form 1040. </p>        <p>Final general election polls.
