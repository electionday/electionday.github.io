        <h2><strong>Election day purpose 2024 election results recount</strong></h2>
        <p>2:03. Why is <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> always on the first Tuesday in November? Many people argue voting is a citizen&#39;s &quot;civic duty.&quot; <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> is one of the most important days of the year, especially this ...  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> in the United States is the annual day for general elections of federal, state and local public officials. With respect to federal elections, it is statutorily set by the U.S. government as &quot;the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November&quot; [ 1 ] of even-numbered years (i.e., the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8).  If you&rsquo;re voting in person on <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>, find your polling place and its hours. See what ID you need to vote. Find out where to get a sample ballot.  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> is the <b>day</b> legally established to select public officials in the United States. General <b>elections</b> for federal offices&mdash;President, Vice President, and U.S. Congress&mdash;are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years.  Do some people vote on other days in the fall? Here are some answers to those and other questions about <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>. 1. Elections took place way before the Constitution was ratified. The English in particular conducted voting soon after they landed in Virginia in the 17 th Century.  Election <b>Day</b> is the day legally established for the general <b>election</b>, sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;popular election,&rdquo; of federal public officials: President, Vice President, and Members of the U.S.  For decades, federal elections in the United States have been held on the Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> in November. Why this date? Originally, election days varied by state, but in 1845 a law was passed to set a single election day for the entire country.  Election day or polling day is the <b>day</b> on <b>which</b> <b>general</b> <b>elections</b> are held. In many countries, general elections are always held on a Saturday or Sunday, to enable as many voters as possible to participate; while in other countries elections are always held on a weekday.  The primary purpose of <b>early</b> voting is <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>participation</b> <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>congestion</b> at <b>voting</b> centers on election <b>day</b>. Election day voting, on the other hand, occurs on a specific day when voters go to their designated polling stations to cast their votes. </p>        <p>Election results warrington pa.
