        <p>The list of <b>Trump</b> rallies has been spread across two articles: List of rallies for the 2016 Donald <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign. List of post&ndash;2016 election Donald <b>Trump</b> rallies. Category: Lists of lists.  NEW YORK (AP) &mdash; Republican Donald <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;s <b>rally</b> on Sunday at Madison Square Garden follows a long line of political events at the storied New York City arena.. The Garden has hosted both Democratic and Republican National Conventions since the 1800s, and in 1939, thousands joined back-to-back pro-Nazi and Communist Party rallies in the lead-up to World War II.  At a <b>Trump</b> <b>rally</b>, even the rioters who attacked the capitol on Jan. 6 are recast as victims of anti-<b>Trump</b> forces. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; an announcer&#39;s deep voice boomed over dramatic music ...  His inauguration, which was functionally a <b>rally</b>, set the tone for the new administration: <b>Trump</b> falsely insisted that it was the largest inauguration crowd in American <b>history</b>.  Mr. <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;s <b>rally</b> comes almost exactly a century after the Garden&rsquo;s most chaotic political event, the 1924 Democratic Convention, where the party, fiercely divided over immigration and other ...  Donald <b>Trump</b>: What we learned from his <b>rally</b> in Pennsylvania. Donald <b>Trump</b> has called President Joe Biden an &quot;enemy of the state&quot; at his first <b>rally</b> since the FBI searched his Florida resort for ...  T wenty-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks was identified by the FBI on Sunday, July 14, as the shooter behind the attempted assassination of former President Donald <b>Trump</b> during a campaign <b>rally</b> in ...  So, for example, if a we saw reports that &ldquo;thousands&rdquo;, &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo;, and &ldquo;about 30,000&rdquo; attended a <b>Trump</b> or Biden <b>rally</b>, we would convert those words to 2,000 and 20,000, respectively, and then average the lowest and highest of all the resulting values &mdash; here, 2,000 and 30,000 &mdash; to arrive at a conservative point estimate ...  Much of the media unloaded on former President <b>Trump</b>&#39;s historic Sunday night <b>rally</b> at Madison Square Garden in New York City, claiming it mirrored a Nazi <b>rally</b> at the famous venue in the 1930s ... </p>        <p>Richland county ohio election results november 2024.
