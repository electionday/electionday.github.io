Proponents of <b>making</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> a federal <b>holiday</b> argue the policy would promote higher <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in <b>elections</b> by allowing more people to vote without sacrificing a <b>day</b> off work. In the 2020 <b>election</b>, one poll found that 13.1% of participants who were registered voters did not vote because they were busy or had a scheduling conflict.  <b>Making</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> a federal <b>holiday</b> is not an out-of-the-blue concept in the U.S. as well.
