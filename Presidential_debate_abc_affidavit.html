        <p>The <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump took place on Sept. 29, in what turned out to be the third most watched <b>presidential</b>...  The <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> between Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy took place on Monday, September 26, 1960, at the WBBM-TV studios in Chicago, Illinois. The <b>debate</b> was moderated by Howard K. Smith of CBS with Sander Vanocur, Charles Warren, Stuart Novins and Bob Fleming as panelists.  Many Americans think of the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon debate as the first televised presidential debate. But some argue the first came <b>four</b> years earlier.  The <b>debate</b> is considered the <b>first</b> nationally televised <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> in history.

The <b>first</b> televised <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> in American history took place between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon on September 26, 1960.  The <b>first</b> televised <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon was a watershed moment in American political history. It revolutionized how candidates communicated with voters, establishing televised debates as a fundamental aspect of electoral campaigns.  In this episode, we&#39;ll look closely at the first Kennedy and Nixon debate, including the preparation, results, and its impact on the rest of the campaign. This <b>is</b> <b>60/20</b>. Many know 1960 as the first time presidential candidates would debate live on TV.  For the <b>first</b> time in history, the two party-nominated candidates for president of the United States were about to <b>debate</b> with television cameras trained on them. And President Richard Nixon was beginning to regret agreeing to it.  The first widely seen debates between presidential nominees were held in 1960 when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon squared off on television four times. It took another <b>16</b> <b>years</b> for the practice to resume when Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford debated at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia. </p>        <p><a href="https://electionday.github.io/591.html">Election results logan county</a>. 2024 election results by county north carolina.
