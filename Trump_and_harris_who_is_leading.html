        <h2><strong>Trump and harris who is leading Register to vote danville il</strong></h2>
        <p>Voting <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>felony</b> <b>automatically</b>. Instead, people must submit an application for restoration to the governor&#39;s office upon completion of their sentence, including prison time, parole, and probation, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  In the District of Columbia, Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right <b>to vote</b>, even while they are incarcerated. In 23 states, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and receive automatic restoration upon release. Note that in Maryland, convictions for buying or selling votes <b>can</b> only be restored through pardon.  In 23 states, those with <b>felony</b> convictions automatically regain the right <b>to vote</b> when they are released from prison. This means that formerly incarcerated people <b>can</b> <b>vote</b> while serving probation or while out on parole.  This map from the Brennan Center for Justice summarizes state laws on criminal disenfranchisement. These laws strip voting rights from people with past <b>criminal</b> convictions&mdash;and they vary widely by state.  If you lost your voting rights because of a conviction, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>register</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> immediately after your release. Pretrial detention, misdemeanors, probation, and parole do not restrict your voting rights.  <b>You</b> can register to vote when you complete your <b>sentence</b>* (Alaska Statutes 15.05.030). If you have a felony involving moral turpitude on your record, you can register to vote when you are unconditionally discharged.  This guide walks readers through a series of questions to help them understand how each state&rsquo;s laws work. And it gives information about how to reach officials in a particular state if someone wants to <b>register</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> or if they have additional questions.  People convicted of a felony between <b>Jan</b>. <b>15</b>, <b>1973</b>, and May 17, 1981, are eligible to <b>register</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> regardless of the crime committed. People convicted of certain felonies prior to Jan. 15, 1973 may be barred from voting.  WHO CANNOT REGISTER AND VOTE? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>to</b> <b>register</b> and vote if you: &bull; Are currently confined in a penal institution for conviction of a felony (even if you are also incarcerated for one or more misdemeanor offenses) and will not be released from confinement before the next election; </p>        <p><a href="https://electionday.github.io/533.html">Youtube presidential debate from last night</a>.
