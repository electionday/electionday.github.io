        <h2><strong>Us election polls 2024 wikipedia Trump vance harris walz</strong></h2>
        <p>President Biden and former President <b>Trump</b> traded barbs and a variety of false and misleading information as they faced off in their first <b>debate</b> of the 2024 election.. <b>Trump</b> falsely represented the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as a relatively small number of people who were ushered in by police and misstated the strength of the economy during his administration.  <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;s team ahead of the <b>debate</b> equated the Republican standard-bearer to boxing great Muhammad Ali.

[144] He later reiterated these comments in a tweet saying &quot;Steve Scully, the second <b>Debate</b> Moderator, is a Never Trumper, just like the son of the great Mike Wallace. Fix!!!&quot;.  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald <b>Trump</b> faced off on facts, dueled on policy and traded barbs during the presidential <b>debate</b> hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, in which he also ... </p>        <p>Election results 2024 all parties.
