        <h2><strong>Is election day the only day to vote Kamala harris debate earphones</strong></h2>
        <p>Presidential elections occur every four years on <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>, which since 1845 has been the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.  The 2024 <b>election</b> will be held on Nov. 5, 2024. <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, according to the Department of Justice. Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the ...  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> in the United States is the annual <b>day</b> for general <b>elections</b> of federal, state, and/or local public officials. It is statutorily set by the U.S. government as &quot;the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November&quot; [1] of even-numbered years, i.e. the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8.  Presidential <b>elections</b> occur quadrennially on <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>, which since 1845 has been the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, [1] [2] coinciding with the general <b>elections</b> of various other federal, state, and local races.  Since 1845, to streamline the voting process and to avoid influencing voters by early <b>election</b> returns, Congress has set <b>election</b> <b>day</b> for the entire country as &ldquo;the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November&rdquo; or &ldquo;the first Tuesday after November 1.&rdquo;  Americans first began the custom of weekday voting in 1845, when Congress passed a federal law designating the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>.  Election day or polling <b>day</b> is the day on which general elections are held. In many countries, general elections are always held on a Saturday or Sunday, to enable as many voters as possible to participate; while in other countries elections are always held on a weekday.  Tuesday was chosen because it was most convenient for farmers traveling by horse and buggy at the time. &ldquo;In 1845, when Congress established a national <b>election</b> <b>day</b>, it had to be a Tuesday because farmers went to church on Sunday, went to market on Wednesday, and may have needed a <b>day</b>, Monday, to get to their polling place,&rdquo; Gil Troy &mdash; an ...  For decades, federal elections in the United States have been held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Why this date? Originally, <b>election </b>days varied by state, but in 1845 a law was passed to set a single <b>election day </b>for the entire country. </p>        <p><a href="/285.html">1st presidential debate date 2024</a>. <a href="/843.html">Election day 2024 guidelines</a>.
