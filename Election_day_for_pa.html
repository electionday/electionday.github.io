        <h2><strong>Election day for pa Trump sneakers where to buy them</strong></h2>
        <p>In the national popular <b>vote</b>, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>beat</b> <b>Nixon</b> by less than two-tenths of one percentage point (0.17%), the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century.  <b>Kennedy</b> eked out a narrow victory in the popular vote, defeating Nixon by just under 117,000 votes. Overall, Kennedy won 49.7 percent to Nixon&rsquo;s 49.5 percent.  In a United States presidential <b>election</b>, the <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> is the total number or the percentage of votes cast for a candidate by voters in the 50 states and Washington, D.C.; the candidate who gains the most votes nationwide is said to have won the popular vote.  <b>John</b> <b>F</b>. <b>Kennedy</b> won the popular vote by a slim margin of approximately 100,000 votes. Richard Nixon won more individual states than Kennedy, but it was Kennedy who prevailed by winning key states with many electoral votes. To mollify these concerns, Kennedy addressed a group of Protestant ministers.  In Mississippi, the eight Unpledged Electors <b>voted</b> for Harry Byrd (President) and Strom Thurmond (Vice President). In Oklahoma, one Nixon Elector cast his vote for Harry Byrd (President) and Barry Goldwater (Vice President). In Alabama, the 11 Presidential Electors were directly elected.  Kennedy&#39;s <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> margin of victory was the closest in any presidential <b>election</b> in the 20th century, with Kennedy garnering 0.17% more of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> than his opponent. [2][3] Nixon, the first sitting vice president to win either party&#39;s nomination since John C. Breckinridge in 1860, easily won his party&#39;s nomination.  <b>1960</b> <b>Electoral</b> College <b>Results</b>. Byrd received electoral <b>votes</b> for President from Alabama (6), Mississippi (8) and Oklahoma (1). Thurmond received electoral votes for Vice President from Alabama (6) and Mississippi (8). Goldwater received 1 electoral vote for Vice President from Oklahoma.  269 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> to win. Change history with the <b>1960</b> presidential <b>election</b> interactive map.
