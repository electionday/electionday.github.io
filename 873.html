        <h2><strong>What happened in the presidential debate last night Presidential debate june 27 2024 time</strong></h2>
        <p>President Biden struggled through his first <b>debate</b> of the 2024 campaign against Donald J. Trump, meandering and mumbling through answers as the former president pressed his case for a second term...  Biden reiterated several of the points he made during last night&#39;s presidential debate, including vowing to make Roe v. Wade &quot;the law of the land&quot; and to bring <b>down</b> <b>inflation</b>.  After weeks of intense speculation and anticipation, we now know the outcome of what may be the only <b>presidential</b> <b>debate</b> between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris before voters cast their ballots.  Biden&#39;s <b>halting</b> performance overshadowed a <b>debate</b> in which Trump declined opportunities to assuage voter concerns about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and his legal troubles.  The lively <b>debate</b> between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump on Tuesday evening touched on the economy, immigration, abortion, democracy and climate change. The...  The performance of US President Joe Biden at <b>last</b> <b>night</b>&rsquo;s <b>CNN</b> <b>debate</b> with former President Donald Trump is being mocked on Russian state media, with pundits questioning the state of his ...  The format of Thursday night&rsquo;s debate, in which candidates were blocked from interrupting each other and not subjected to fact-checking, appeared to serve <b>Mr</b>. <b>Trump</b>, who seemed content to sit...  Kamala Harris baited Donald <b>Trump</b> for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate on Tuesday night &ndash; and Trump took every bit of it.  In their <b>debate</b> Thursday <b>night</b> on <b>CNN</b>, the gap between the 81-year-old incumbent and his 78-year-old challenger seemed much larger. Biden, hoarse and displaying little vocal range, was often... </p>        <p>Trump polls vs biden. How do i register to vote in nc. Kamala harris home tax plan.
