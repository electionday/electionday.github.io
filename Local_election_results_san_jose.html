        <p>Visit <b>vote</b>.<b>gov</b> to begin the voter registration process. Select your state or territory. Depending on its rules, you will find instructions on how to register: Online. By mail. In person at your local election office. Start your registration on vote.gov.  Even if there&rsquo;s not an imminent election on the calendar, however, <b>it</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>best</b> to <b>register</b> to <b>vote</b> <b>early</b> on after your <b>move</b> so that you don&rsquo;t forget to do it later. Check if you&rsquo;re already registered. The next thing you&rsquo;ll need to do is see if you are already registered to vote in your state.  If you are not already registered or <b>need</b> to update your <b>registration</b>, make sure to <b>do</b> so by your state&rsquo;s deadline. Several states allow voters to <b>register</b> on Election Day, but other states have a deadline up to 30 days before the election.  Learn how to change your voter <b>registration</b> after <b>moving</b> and understand the importance of updating your <b>registration</b> to participate in upcoming elections.  If you have missed the voter <b>registration</b> deadline, you can still register to vote and a cast a ballot at the same time during early voting (if your county conducts early voting) or on Election Day. Simply go to your regular polling place or early voting site to register and vote.  You need to <b>update</b> your voter registration after a change of address, whether you moved in-state or out of state. If you moved out of state, register with the state you moved to. Submit your changes before your state&rsquo;s registration deadline, which can be as early as 30 days before Election Day.  If you have moved since you last voted, it is best to complete and file a new voter <b>registration</b> <b>form</b> to update your address. Below is a step by step guide for how to file a new voter registration form: Go to Register to Vote.  Planning Your Move. Make sure your vote still counts after moving out of state. Voting in elections is the constitutional right of U.S. citizens who meet the requirements. But to vote on local, state or national issues, you <b>must</b> <b>be</b> registered to vote in your state.  Do you need to re-register or change your <b>registration</b>? <b>No</b>, if: Your name and address have not changed, and you are an active voter. Yes, if: You have moved within your state or changed your name. Update your voter registration with your new location or your new name. Make sure you also update your state driver&#39;s license or state ID card before ... </p>        <p>November 19 2020 trump press conference. Will tonights presidential debate be televised.
