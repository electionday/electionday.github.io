        <p>Harris wins an Electoral College landslide (350+ electoral votes) 7 out of 100. <b>Trump </b>wins an Electoral College landslide (350+ electoral votes) 2 out of 100. Harris wins the Electoral College with &lt;350 electoral votes. 38 out of 100. <b>Trump </b>wins the Electoral College with &lt;350 electoral votes. 50 out of 100. Harris wins the national popular vote.  Polling averages are adjusted based on state and national <b>polls</b>, which means candidates&rsquo; averages can shift even if no new <b>polls</b> have been added to this page. Read the full methodology here. On Sept. 13, 2024, we fixed a bug in this polling average that arose after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race on Aug. 23, 2024.  When the dates of tracking <b>polls</b> from the same pollster overlap, only the most recent version is shown.

In 2024, the most recent Emerson <b>poll</b> has Trump leading Biden by 2 points, while the most recent HarrisX <b>poll</b> has him up by 4 (IBD/TIPP have not released any <b>polls</b> this cycle). It seems strange to think that pollsters that were so close in 2020 would try to pick up missing Trump voters in 2024- HarrisX even had a small bias in Trump&#39;s favour.  The final national NBC News <b>poll</b> of the 2024 presidential campaign finds a neck and neck contest defined by clashing forces that have aided both Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump ...  Who is leading national <b>polls</b>? Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July and she remains ahead - as shown in the chart ...  <b>Trump </b>lost 2020 by around 45,000 votes divided between 3 states (WI, AZ, and GA). Against an unpopular Democrat like Harris, he could pull it off, especially if he became more 2016-like.
