Kamala Harris baited Donald <b>Trump</b> for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate on Tuesday night &ndash; and Trump took every bit of it.  Independent candidate RFK Jr. spoke to All Things Considered about the <b>Biden</b>-<b>Trump</b> <b>debate</b> and what it means for his third-party run for the presidency. </p>        <p><a href="/409.html">Election results for park county wyoming</a>.
