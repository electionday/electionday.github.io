        <h2><strong>Kamala harris on key issues Election day shuffle along</strong></h2>
        <p>Based on our research, the claims about both <b>Harris</b> and Barrett are TRUE. <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b> failed the bar exam on her first try, and Amy Coney Barrett graduated <b>law</b> <b>school</b> at the top of her...  While attending law <b>school</b> in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b>, Harris lived with her sister, Maya, and helped potty-train Maya&rsquo;s daughter.  [22] [23] Harris then attended the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> California, <b>Hastings</b> <b>College</b> of the Law in San Francisco, [24] where she served as president of its chapter of the Black Law Students Association. [25]  After obtaining her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Howard University, a historically Black university located in Washington D.C., <b>Harris</b> shifted back to the Golden State to attend her <b>law</b> <b>school</b> alma...  Her <b>law</b> <b>school</b> years &mdash; the era of Harris&rsquo; life that perhaps has gotten the least public scrutiny to date &mdash; offer a window into how she thinks about her role as a politician and a Black woman in...  Following her undergraduate studies, Harris attended the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b>, <b>Hastings</b> <b>College</b> of the Law, where she served as president of the Black Law Students Association.  <b>Harris</b> then returned to California to attend the University of California, Hastings College of the <b>Law</b> (later renamed in 2023 to the University of California College of the <b>Law</b>, San Francisco) through its Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP).

After gaining a law degree, Harris worked as a deputy <b>district</b> attorney (1990&ndash;98) in Oakland, California, earning a reputation for toughness as she prosecuted cases of gang violence, drug trafficking, and sexual abuse.
